# terraform-infrastructure

To deploy our infrastructure we must set up the terraform.tfvars and execute the following:

```javascript
$ terraform init
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
```
In case we need to update our infrastructure we should use the refresh option:
```javascript
$ terraform refresh
```
